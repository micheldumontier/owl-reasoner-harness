"""Cross-reasoner subsumption normaliser + FP/MISSED comparator.

Four reasoners emit four incompatible shapes. This normalises each to a sorted set
of `sub<TAB>sup` lines over NAMED classes so two runs can be diffed.

    normalise.py normalise --format <rustdl|konclude|hermit|km> FILE [--ontology SRC]
    normalise.py compare CANDIDATE.tsv ORACLE.tsv [--json]
    normalise.py gate [--only pizza,bibtex,...]

## The four input shapes (all determined empirically, see DECISIONS.md)

| reasoner | relation emitted | identifiers | equivalence |
|---|---|---|---|
| rustdl   | DIRECT (Hasse)   | full IRI    | `equiv<TAB>a<TAB>b…` line |
| Konclude | DIRECT (Hasse)   | full IRI + `abbreviatedIRI` | `EquivalentClasses` |
| HermiT   | DIRECT (Hasse)   | full IRI    | `EquivalentClasses`, one rep per group |
| KM       | TRANSITIVE CLOSURE | LOCAL NAME | mutual subsumption, + `Q_*` definers |

## Normalisation policy

R2 **Relation: transitive closure.** Three of four emit the Hasse diagram, KM emits
   the closure. The closure is the only relation all four can be brought to
   agreement on (direct -> closure is total; closure -> direct requires the input to
   be complete, which is exactly what is under test). It is also the relation
   rustdl's own `oracle_diff::aligned_closures` counts, so the committed FP=0
   reference numbers are closure counts.

R3 **owl:Thing / owl:Nothing / reflexive: dropped.** Any pair naming Thing or
   Nothing on either side is dropped, as is every reflexive `C C` pair. Konclude
   emits `X SubClassOf Thing`, HermiT does not; keeping them would make the diff a
   diff of output conventions. Thing is recognised in all three spellings that
   occur: the absolute IRI, the bare relative form `Thing` (ROBOT writes
   `<Class IRI="Thing"/>` against `xml:base`), and `abbreviatedIRI="owl:Thing"`.

R4 **Equivalent classes: expanded to mutual subsumption.** An equivalence group
   becomes the full bidirectional star, so `C ≡ D` yields both `C D` and `D C`.
   Necessary, not cosmetic: HermiT emits only ONE representative of a group in its
   SubClassOf edges (`E ⊑ C` with `D ≡ E`), so without expansion `D ⊑ C` is lost.
   Two special groups are NOT expanded but recorded as sidecar metadata:
   `EquivalentClasses(owl:Nothing, …)` members are UNSATISFIABLE and
   `EquivalentClasses(owl:Thing, …)` members are THING-EQUIVALENT. Both are
   excluded from the pair set, because reasoners disagree on whether to enumerate
   the (vacuous) pairs they participate in.

R1 **KM's Tseitin definers: whitelist, never a regex.** KM leaks internal definers
   (`Q_1`, `Q_10`, …) into `subsumptions`. A `^Q_\d+$` blacklist would silently eat
   a legitimate class named `Q_1`. Instead every KM name is checked against the set
   of classes DECLARED in the source ontology (`--ontology`), keyed by local name —
   a whitelist, the same shape as rustdl's `reportable_class_iris`. Anything not
   declared in the input cannot be a legitimate answer. This also solves KM's other
   problem: it reports LOCAL NAMES, not IRIs, so the whitelist doubles as the
   local-name -> full-IRI map needed to compare it against the other three.

## Symmetric exclusion (why normalise emits sidecar lines)

The unsat / thing-equivalent exclusion must be applied SYMMETRICALLY across both
sides of a diff -- if reasoner A proves C unsatisfiable and B does not, then B's
pairs mentioning C are an artefact of that disagreement, not false positives. A
single-file normaliser cannot know the other side's unsat set, so it emits its own
as machine-readable `#unsat` / `#thing-equiv` comment lines and `compare` takes the
union. Data lines never start with `#`, so a consumer that only wants pairs can
`grep -v '^#'`.
